# INGInious Blockly tasks

This repository contains multiple tasks inside multiple courses that I wrote to
show how you can integrate Blockly inside INGInious.

## Hello World

Hello world is a very basic task without visual animation where the user has
to use a block to print `Hello World!`. The goal is to show a very minimal
example of usage and creation of a blockly task in INGInious.

## Maze

The maze activity comes from Blockly Games. It was a proof of concept that you
can use Blockly inside INGInious, that you can run the code locally with the
JS-Interpreter and also test it on a Docker container through INGInious and keep
a trace of the submissions (blocks and code).

It is not a visually attractive as pvz and does not cover more concepts, the
last level is very hard so I do not think it is the best way to start for a kid,
but it might be for older students. 

## Plant VS Zombie (pvz)

This is a maze that we proposed during the *Printemps des Sciences* event in
March 2017. It comes from Code.org where the activity is done for the
*Hour of code*, it takes approximately one hour to a 12 years old kid to
complete. A zombie needs to reach a goal (a sunflower) through a maze where
there might be some obstacles that may eat him.

The main concepts are :

* Sequential execution
* For loops, while loops
* If and if-else conditions

## Bee

This is a maze where the player is a bee that needs to gather nectar and make
honey, a flower might contains more than one nectar and a hive can contain more
than one honey. This activity also comes from Code.org and is more advanced
than Plant VS Zombie, we used bee for kids that were too fast at finishing pvz
during the *Printemps des Sciences*

The main concepts are:

* Sequential execution
* For loops
* Function calls
* Functions writing
